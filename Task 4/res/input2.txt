Thats strange, she thinks .

Mrs Brown goes to feed the chickens .

She looks in the backyard. No chickens .

Mrs Brown goes to see the cows .

She looks in the barn. No cows .

Thats strange, she thinks .

Mrs Brown looks in the field. No animals .

Where are the sheep? Where are the pigs? Wheres the horse? Thats very strange! she thinks .

Mrs Brown hears a noise behind the house .

She goes to look .

Everyones in the garden: Mr Brown, Max, the chickens, the cows, the pigs and the horse .
